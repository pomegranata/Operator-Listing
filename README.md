# Arknights Operator Query with Exception Handling
This Java project demonstrates how to use exception handling (try-catch) with Arknights Operators as query objects. The project provides a basic framework for querying operators by name and handling potential errors, such as when an operator is not found.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a simple application that allows users to query Arknights Operators by name. The program handles various exceptions that may occur, such as trying to query an operator that does not exist in the list.
